# skincare-Ingredients

This dashboard is not designed for analysis; I would characterize it as an informative dashboard. Its primary goal is to consolidate all relevant information into a single location. This could prove beneficial for individuals within the skincare industry. The regulatory team can investigate CAS numbers or chemical names, a chemist can delve into product functionalities, a new business owner can explore product launch possibilities, and end users can gain insights into the ingredients used in their daily skincare routines.

I plan to continuously update this file by incorporating details such as country of origin, product alternatives, images, etc. Therefore, I encourage regular visits to this page. Any suggestions or advice are highly appreciated.

It's important to note that the information in the list is gathered from various sources on Google. Refer to the attached list in this repository for details.
